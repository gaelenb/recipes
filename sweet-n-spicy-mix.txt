Haven't made this in a while so I might be forgetting an ingredient..
Ingredients:
- 1 cup almonds
- 1-2  cups  favorite cereal
	- honey bunches of oats almonds 
	- kashi protein clusters( or something?)
  
- pecans (can take em or leave em delicious but not so nutritious)
- tablespoon of cinnamon 
- ~1/3 cup of honey
- paprika 
- cayenne pepper powder

Mix up nuts and cereal 
mix up spices in separate bowl
Drizzle honey on nut/cereal mix while mixing it
- do this till stickiness is spread all over
- shake on spice mix while mixing the mix

take out a metal cookie sheet,
	 throw some parchment paper on the sheet
		dump the mix on the cookie sheet and spread it out   

Put in the oven at ~ 200 degrees F
 remove from oven when you start smelling that cinnamon or like 15-20 minutes

try to avoid eating it all immediately
